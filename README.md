# Resource Sustainability and Quorum Sensing

What happens when a group of individuals decide amongst themselves to exploit a renewable resource? We try to address this question in the context of swarms of agents which make decisions on the basis of quorum sensing.

## Aspects of the Problem Being Studied

- Interplay between quality of resourrce and the number of agents exploiting it.
- Agents trying to convince each other to make a certain choice.
- Agents' awareness about the overall choice profile of the group.
- Agents' perception about the presence or abscence of a quorum.
- The change in behavior of the individuals in presence or absence of a percieved quorum.


## Current Focus

Currently we study the scenario with only one resource in the system and the agents deciding whether to exploit it or not. Our approach currently is two-pronged:

### Decision Profile Detection

If the decisions of the individual agents do not change, __can the agent know about the fraction of the group which is exploiting the recource?__

### Impact of Interactions on Decision Profile and Quality of Resource

If too too few agents exploit the resource, the resource gathered may not suffice the needs of the group. On the other hand, if too many agents eploit the resource, the resource may get depleted and hence not suffice the need of the group.

Moreover, agents may interact and convince each other to either exploit the resource or not.

__How to obatin sustainable resources for the group in such a scenario?__

## Future Directions

We aim to combine the two prongs: If the knowledge of the decision profile, and hence the presence or absence of a quorum affecrs the interaction rate, how does it impact the sustainability of the resource?
